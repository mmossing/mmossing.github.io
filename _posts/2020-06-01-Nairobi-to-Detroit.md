After arriving in Capetown in May of 2019, with a perfectly serviceable arm for steering, braking and leaning on the handlebar, I traveled back to Toledo to begin to rehab the shoulder and regain the strength in my shoulder.  

Some jogging, and light strength training, led to swimming easy laps in the pool.  One morning on my jog to the YMCA,  I noticed a group of folks running around a warehouse. It was a crossfit gym!  Crossfit (mostly scaled to accomodate my dodgy shoulder) soon became my go-to workout modality. 

I continued through the rest of 2019 getting stronger by the month. 

Not knowing what to do with myself, I decided to travel back to Africa to fill in the countries that I had missed in 2019.

I left from San Francisco just as the first documented cases of Sars-Cov-2 began to accumulate in the US. I arrived in Nairobi and made it as far as Tanzania, when the world began to shut down due to the pandemic.

I documented the trip on Strava. Here are links to individual strava activities with a few highlight photos.

After arriving back in New Orleans, I began to look for a way to help with Covid testing. 

No Luck in NOLA.  Nor in San Francisco where I has left my car.  I applied for several positions at CDC and FDA.  Finally I was lucky to find a position with the CDC foundation to help with Covid Testing in Detroit.
