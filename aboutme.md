title: About me
---

My name is Mike Mossing,  I'm heading out for a new adventure soon riding my bike down the west coast of South America from Cartagena to Ushuaia [South American Epic - TDA Global Cycling](https://tdaglobalcycling.com/south-american-epic).


- In the past I have been a professor of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry.

- I've done some slow traveling, riding my bike around Bavaria, walking across Northern Spain, and riding from Cairo to Capetown (mostly) also with TDA.

- Most recently I worked with the CDC foundation and the Detroit Health Department to help coordinate Covid testing in the city.
